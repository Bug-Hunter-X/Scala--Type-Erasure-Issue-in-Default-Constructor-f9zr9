This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Scala related to type erasure and default constructors. The `MyClass` class tries to provide a default constructor using `null.asInstanceOf[T]`. This approach can work for some types but will fail for others, potentially throwing exceptions at runtime or leading to unexpected behavior if T is not a nullable type. The solution illustrates a safer and more robust method to handle default values in generic classes.
